# Bidao

The BiDao Cryptocurrency (BID) utilizes a decentralized proof-of-stake Blockchain with an additional collateral-backed token which is 100% stable in value quite in contrast to for example Bitcoin, Binance Coin or Ethereum which experience huge fluctuation. The goal is to enable BNB as collateral. In future, BiDao will be also integrated with other Blockchains like Ethereum, Tezos, and EOS. This way BiDao becomes the one-stop-shop for Decentralized Finance (Defi) applications.
